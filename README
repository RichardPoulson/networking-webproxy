Programming Assignment 3: WebProxy

I had a lot of trouble with this assignment, I was just able to get
threading to work before the assignment was due.

To make this program, simply navigate to the root of this folder
and enter the command "make recycle".  This will automatically do a
clean, make the binary, and then run "./pa3 8888 15", which means
run on port 8888 with a 15 second timeout_

I was able to get the listening socket to time out, and the program
will send a bad message error if the method isn't GET
